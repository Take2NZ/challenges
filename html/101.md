# HTML 101

## Exercises

### Escaping

- What happens when you want to write the words `"<h1>"` inside your
  HTML without making a new element? How can this be solved?
- Can you write the word "Ōtepoti" with this technique?

### Comments

- google HTML comment syntax and add comments on your HTML

### Headlines

- "h1-h6": find out about different levels of headlines, when and how often to use which.

### Tables

- HTML has a `<table>` element. Find out how to use it and make a table that works as a
  restaurant menu. List 5 dishes, and for every dish make up and list both a normal price,
  and a discounted price.

### Misc

- Browse the MDN docs (linked at learn.take2.org) and write out one thing we
  haven't done in class. Prepare to introduce it in a short presentation to your
  class: talk about what it is, and showing an example both as source code
  and in the browser.

## Project

you see driving around, you're free to pick any topic.

- Use at least three different headlines
- Use at least three paragraph elements.
- Use at least two horizontal rules and two breaks.
