# HTML 102

## Exercises

### Memorize the basic structure of HTML

Create a blank HTML file and write the basic HTML structure from memory. Include the doctype, and a title.
Find out at least one other doctype.

### Identify and use HTML attributes

Given a list of HTML elements, add appropriate attributes to each.

- Find out what the `alt` attribute for `<img>` tags does and demonstrate its use.
- Find out what the `target` attribute for `<a>` tags does and demonstrate at least two options.

### Use semantic elements appropriately

Convert a non-semantic HTML layout to a semantic one. Given the following non-semantic HTML structure:

```
<div id="header">
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
</div>
<div id="main-content">
  <p>This is the main content area.</p>
</div>
<div id="footer">
  <p>Contact us at info@example.com</p>
</div>
```

Rewrite it using appropriate semantic elements.
